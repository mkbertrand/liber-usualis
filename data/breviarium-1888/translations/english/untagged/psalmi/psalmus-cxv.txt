1 I have believed, therefore have I spoken; * but I have been humbled exceedingly.
2 I said in my excess: * Every man is a liar.
3 What shall I render to the Lord, * for all the things he hath rendered unto me?
4 I will take the chalice of salvation; * and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
5 I will pay my vows to the Lord before all his people: * Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
6 O Lord, for I am thy servant: * I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid.
7 Thou hast broken my bonds: + I will sacrifice to thee the sacrifice of praise, * and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
8 I will pay my vows to the Lord in the sight of all his people: * In the courts of the house of the Lord, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
