Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, * for He hath visited and redeemed His people.
And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us, * in the house of His servant David:
As He spake by the mouth of His holy Prophets, * which have been since the world began:
That we should be saved from our enemies, * and from the hand of all that hate us:
To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, * and to remember His holy covenant:
The oath which He sware to our father Abraham, * that He would grant unto us,
That we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, * might serve Him without fear,
In holiness and righteousness before Him * all the days of our life.
And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Highest: * for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways:
To give knowledge of salvation unto His people, * by the remission of their sins;
Through the tender mercy of our God, * whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,
To give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, * to guide our feet into the way of peace.
