1 Save me, O God, by thy name, * and judge me in thy strength.
2 O God, hear my prayer: * give ear to the words of my mouth.
3 For strangers have risen up against me; + and the mighty have sought after my soul: * and they have not set God before their eyes.
4 For behold God is my helper: * and the Lord is the protector of my soul.
5 Turn back the evils upon my enemies; * and cut them off in thy truth.
6 I will freely sacrifice to thee, * and will give praise, O God, to thy name: because it is good:
7 For thou hast delivered me out of all trouble: * and my eye hath looked down upon my enemies.
