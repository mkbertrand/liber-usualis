		<h1>Help the Liber Usualis Project</h1>
		<p>The Liber Usualis Project is still nascent and in need of much work both to fill out all the text of the Hours, and to develop the many other resources and tools which it still lacks.</p>
		<p>The best way you can help is to contribute to the Github by submitting issues whenever you notice anything missing or incorrect, and by submitting pull requests.  Our code is hosted as a Git repository on <a href="https://github.com/mkbertrand/liber-usualis">Github</a>.</p>
		<p>Additionally, financial contributions are most welcome. I have not yet established a donation site to make the process convenient for donors. However, I do need money. For now, please reach out personally at <a href="mailto:bertrandm@duq.edu">bertrandm@duq.edu</a> to discuss donations.</p>
