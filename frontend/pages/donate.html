		<h2>A message from Miles</h2>
		<p>So far, I've likely logged over 2,000 hours to bring the Liber Usualis Project to where it is now.  While it is in a state of relative usability for many portions of the liturgical year, it is likely that hundreds or thousands more hours of labor will be needed.  For this reason, I'm seeking donations in order to ensure that I can dedicate as much time as possible to the completion of this project, as well as ancillary costs like server equipment and commissions for artwork.  Please consider a monthly or one-time donation to make this great and worthwhile work possible!
