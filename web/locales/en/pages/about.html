		<h1>About the Liber Usualis Project</h1>
		<p>The Liber Usualis Project (nicknamed 'Libu' in my file system) is dedicated to making the Mass, Hours, and Rites of various editions of the Roman Rite easily accessible and beautifully formatted with or without their chants. I've been developing Libu for almost two years, in which time it has gone from a small experiment largely composed of badly made PHP scripts to a fully structured Python program with over eleven hundred Git commits and six contributers.</p>
		<p>The initial interest I had in developing this project was to provide for the lack of chant on the major Divine Office application, <a href="https://divinumofficium.com">Divinum Officium</a>, to which much credit for this project, both in proofreading and in inspiration, is due.  Now that the Liber Usualis Project is growing closer to completion, it has become, in my mind, a realistic goal to provide the following advantages: a project whose code is short (under two thousand lines of Python), data-driven to allow easy implementation of regionalization and various other modifications, and easily extended to allow future goals like creating offline apps and LaTeX conversion.
