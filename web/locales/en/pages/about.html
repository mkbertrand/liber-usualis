		<h1>About the Liber Usualis Project</h1>
		<h2 class="subtitle">Overview</h2>
		<p>The Liber Usualis Project (nicknamed 'Libu' in my file system) is dedicated to making the Mass, Hours, and Rites of various editions of the Roman Rite easily accessible and beautifully formatted with or without their chants. I've been developing Libu for more than two years, in which time it has gone from a small experiment largely composed of poorly cobbled together PHP scripts to a fully structured Python program with over thirteen hundred Git commits and six contributers.</p>
		<p>The initial interest I had in developing this project was to provide for the lack of chant on the major Divine Office application, <a href="https://divinumofficium.com">Divinum Officium</a>, to which much credit for this project, both in proofreading and in inspiration, is due.  As I began more seriously examining Divinum Officium, however, I realized that there was great need for a totally new application.  Now that the Liber Usualis Project is growing closer to completion, it has become, in my mind, a realistic goal to provide the following advantages: a project whose code is short (under 2400 lines of Python), data-driven to allow easy implementation of regionalization and various other modifications, and easily extended to allow future goals like creating offline apps and LaTeX conversion.</p>
		<p>Currently, the website is mostly usable for the Diurnal hours (i.e. everything except for Matins), but lacks most in the way of translations.  I am currently working on the English translations, while a German friend of mine is working on the German translation.  The database has rapidly expanded even just in the last month as I have labored to transcribe the Matins readings from the 1888 Breviary into JSON files.  I expect that this work will continue to pick up pace in the coming months so that we can see a completed Matins, as well as more comprehensive English translations.</p>
		<h2>Future Development</h2>
		<p>As noted above, the two most immediate concerns of mine are working towards the completion of Matins and filling out the English translation in order to allow those without the ability to read Latin to more comfortably and fruitfully pray the Breviary.  However, there are a number of other agenda items which will be forthcoming:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tools to print and make LaTeX versions of any site page</li>
			<li>Other versions of the Breviary</li>
			<li>Other languages</li>
			<li>Rubrical pages and guides on the praying of the Breviary, both practical and spiritual</li>
			<li>Other prayer resources like the Litanies, prayers to be said before Mass, and other Rituals</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>How you can help</h2>
		<p>As noted, this is a very small project; while I am blessed to have a number of other contributors who help directly and indirectly with all sorts of work, there is so much work to be done.  The Github, while not currently open, will be opened soon.  Additionally, financial contributions make the work of this site far more feasible in the future.  If you are interested in getting involved, you can contact me at <a href="mailto:mileskbertrand@gmail.com">mileskbertrand@gmail.com</a>.  You can also join our Discord community at <a href="https://discord.gg/gJMxqJBnQN">https://discord.gg/gJMxqJBnQN</a>.  Currently, the server just has a few members, but I hope that as the website grows, we can build a community of users who can give feedback and, if interested, work on the website.</p>
